## bStats Metrics

![bStats Graph](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/PhantomWorlds.svg)

We use bStats to gather very basic information about servers running PW, all of which is publicly visible [here](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/PhantomWorlds/8916).

None of the information is sensitive in the slightest, as we value your privacy.

No individual server can be siphoned for information as each server contributes to a single pool of data.

We use these metrics to guide our development direction, as these usually help us make decisions without having to manually survey users.

To opt-out, edit the `/plugins/bStats/config.yml` file appropriately and restart your server.
