# About TNK
The New Kings was developed for use on the Official TNE Server as a solution to provide more flexibility,
and enhance the feature-packed nature of other land claim plugins. 

# Why TNK?

## Platform Agnostic
Use TNK on the platform you want!
- Sponge? If you want
- Spigot/Paper? Definitely!

## Features
Want minimal Features? Why not! Want all the features? That's an option too!

The New Kings follows the same philosophy as TNE, which is to allow server owners the option to download
optional "modules" to extend TNK functionality. This also means that the core TNK itself can stay relatively
feature light.

## Multi-world
TNK supports native Multi-world functionality. This means you can have players have different Villages and Kingdoms per world!

## API Support
TNK offers support for Vault, TNE, and Treasury, which lets any third-party plugin hook into your economy and add additional functionality.

## Extensibility
The New Kings has been designed to allow developers to easily add extended features, and even change built-in functionality easily.

## Free as in Freedom, not Free as in Beer
[TNK is licensed under the AGPLv3](developer/license.md), which means you're free to use it how you want. This also means that
networks that add improvements to their version must also provide them for everyone else to enjoy!

## Translations
TNK utilizes Crowdin for Translation management. Find more about contributing to translations
for TNK on the [Translation Guide](developer/Translation-Guide).

## Documented
TNK has lots of documentation for the power users that like all the documentation.

*Please note: As TNK is a work in progress, documentation is very limited at the moment.*

## Requirements
TNK has some minimum requirements that should be followed.
- MySQL 8.0+ (if using MySQL for storage)
- MariaDB 10.7.0+
- Java 17+

## Project Support
We have some organizations that provide open-source licenses to help support this project.
